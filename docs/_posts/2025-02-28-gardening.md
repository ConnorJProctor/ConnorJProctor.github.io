### Spinach

#### Priming
{% include gallery caption="Priming Spinach Seeds" %}
I read online that you increase your chances of germination if you follow this process prior to planting:
1. Soak the seeds in water for 24 hours
2. Dry them on a paper towel for 48 hours
3. Put them in an airtight container for 5 days.

Seeds should be going into the soil on 2025-03-07.
